# About

The [GitHub project TopAlbums](https://github.com/scottcarter/TopAlbums "GitHub project TopAlbums") was created as a result of a code exercise.  It is an iPhone app that displays the top 100 albums across all genres using the Apple RSS generator.   It was created using UIKit,  Auto Layout (without storyboards per the requirements) and URLSession.

## SwiftUI and Combine
For my own interest, I decided to code to the same set of requirements using SwiftUI and Combine in this current project.

Please see the [TopAlbums project](https://github.com/scottcarter/TopAlbums "TopAlbums project") for the full set of requirements.  Unit and UI tests for this SwiftUI project will be added at a later date.
